                        <p style="animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out 0.3s both;">Ricky Horseman Companies began in 1991 with a simple goal: bring solid, honest concrete work to Leesburg and the surrounding communities. What started as a small local operation has grown into a trusted name for residential concrete—patios, walks, and driveways—as well as commercial site work, equipment pads, data center support, and facility services across Northern Virginia.</p>
                        <p style="animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out 0.4s both;">Owner Ricky Horseman has spent more than 20 years in the concrete industry, following a family tradition that spans three generations in the trade. From high-rise buildings and production foundations to residential patios and commercial facility work, he has seen nearly every side of concrete—and built this company around delivering that full range of expertise to every client, regardless of project size or scope.</p>
                        <p style="animation: fadeInUp 0.8s ease-out 0.5s both;">Today, Ricky and his crew combine that experience with a straightforward, no-nonsense approach: show up, prepare the site right, pour and finish carefully, and leave customers with outdoor spaces that look good, drain properly, and stand up to real life. With more than three decades in business and deep roots in Leesburg, the company continues to build long-term relationships one project at a time.</p>

                        <h2>The People Keeping Projects Moving</h2>
                        <p>Ricky Horseman has spent more than two decades in the concrete trade, moving from high-rise pours and production foundations to the specialty patios, walks, and courts he delivers today. He still visits sites personally, lines out the plan, and keeps a close eye on the details before and after the pour.</p>
                        <p>The team stays intentionally small so field leads, project support, and customer-facing roles all stay in sync. The same people you talk to during planning are the ones managing dispatch, walking the site, and making sure communication stays clear once the trucks roll.</p>
                        <p>The approach is simple: arrive when promised, prep the base correctly, manage water and drainage, and leave behind concrete that looks good and holds up for years. It's the standard Ricky wants for his own home, and it's what the crew aims to deliver for every neighbor who calls.</p>

                        <h2>Built on Word of Mouth</h2>
                        <p>Our best advertising hasn't been billboards or big ad campaigns—it's been neighbors pointing at a patio, walk, or driveway and saying, "Ricky's crew did that one," and facility managers recommending us to the property next door. Many of our projects start when someone sees our work, then looks us up on sites like Yelp or Angi before they call.</p>
                        <p>Homeowners trust us with everything from last-minute patios before an open house to new driveways and outdoor pads. Commercial clients count on us for loading areas, equipment slabs, entry aprons, and site concrete that has to hold up under real daily use. Both expect the prep, pour, and cleanup handled with as little disruption as possible—and a finished surface that looks right and stands up over time.</p>
                        <p>On local review platforms, including Yelp and Angi, residential and commercial customers alike often mention the quality of the finished concrete and the value they felt they received. We take that feedback seriously and keep tightening up our scheduling and communication so the experience matches the end result every time.</p>

                        <h2>Why People Choose Us</h2>
                        <p>Most concrete looks similar once it's poured—but how it was prepared, reinforced, and finished makes all the difference in how it holds up. Whether it's a residential patio or a commercial equipment pad, we focus on the details that keep concrete looking good and performing correctly years after the truck pulls away.</p>
                        <p>Our crew handles the work on-site, not a rotating cast of subs, so you know who is on your property and who to call with questions. We show up, prep the base, manage drainage, and clean up when we're done—whether we're in a backyard or on a commercial loading apron.</p>
                        <p>After more than three decades in Leesburg and Northern Virginia, we've built our reputation on word of mouth and repeat clients across both residential and commercial projects. We're a small company by choice, and we plan to be here long after your concrete has cured.</p>
